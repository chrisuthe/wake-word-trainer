# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Pushing to GitHub

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter repository name: `wake-word-trainer` (or your preferred name)
3. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Make it **Public** (recommended for open source)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Local Repository

After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\chris\Downloads\wake-word-trainer-webapp\wake-word-trainer"

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wake-word-trainer.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify on GitHub

Visit your repository URL:
```

You should see all your files, the README, and the MIT license!
